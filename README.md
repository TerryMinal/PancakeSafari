### CLEVERGIPH Overview
Welcome to Clevergiph! In this site, we've fused the Cleverbot and Giphy APIs. Visitors will be able to talk to a Cleverbot (via API calls), while gifs will pop up based on the context of the conversation. The user can save his/her favorite gif, which can be updated throughout the conversation. Once the user quits the conversation, the conversation history will also be saved alongside the favorite gif. All conversation histories can be accessed at any time, but the user will not be able to respond to the conversation.
